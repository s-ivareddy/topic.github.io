        <h2>Transportation</h2>
        <p>We are using school fees, government funding, and private investment for school and college transportation. We have 75 institutions, so we could average 2-3 buses for each institution.</p>
        <p>For hospitals and clinics, there will be about 10-15 ambulances for the whole city.</p>
        <p>The budget for both institutional and clinical transport is 600 crores.</p>
        <p>We have enough agricultural land where the produced goods are grown and shipped to other required towns (for trade/sale). So, transportation is provided to move goods to other cities, including neighboring areas.</p>
        <p>Additionally, we have a water treatment plant in our city where water can be processed, and can be transported to neighbor cities/towns.</p>
        <p>We also need to bring goods that we can't produce in our city, so we will import them from other places.</p>
        <p>Our city is known for its major crop production. To transport goods, we plan to use heavy trucks.</p>
        <p>The budget for this is 4,000 crores.</p>
        <p>For local transportation, we will allow auto rickshaws and mini vans, where they are taxed appropriately.</p>
        <p>In our city, there is a metro system that covers most of the main roads, and the budget for this is 50,000 crores.</p>
        <p>Since many people never own a vehicle, they can use the metro for transportation.</p>
        <p>MNCs can also, for their own purposes, have their own transportation to get raw materials to their factories and transport the produced materials. These are taxpayers (Transportation Association).</p>
        <p>There is a railway station where people can travel to many other cities and towns.</p>
        <p>We have requested the central government for a train route to include our city.</p>
        <p>There are also government buses to many other cities, running at regular intervals based on demand and distance.</p>
        <p>The total budget for institutional, clinical, government buses, and the railway station is 5000 crores.</p>
